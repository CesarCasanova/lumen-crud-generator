## Lumen CRUD Generator

> **IMPORTANT:** This package is a work in progress, it it not stable by any means.   
> Use responsibly! Or don't use at all and wait for v1.0.

#### The purpose of this project

It was created to make creating simple Lumen APIs easier and faster, automating repeatable tasks.

#### Is it any good?

[Yes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

(well, it will be in stable version... I hope...)

## Installation

1. Install the package with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):  
 
```bash
composer require --dev wronx/lumen-crud-generator
```

2. Enable it in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
// edit the environment condition below:
if(!in_array($app->environment(), ['staging', 'production']))
    $app->register(WRonX\LumenCrudGenerator\Providers\LumenCrudGeneratorProvider::class);
```

3. Check if the `make:crud` command is present in the Artisan list.  


## Usage

`php artisan make:crud myModelName [options]`

The command always created CRUD controller for model, the rest depends on the provided options:
 * `-r|--create-routes` adds CRUD routes to routes file
 * `-w|--use-middleware` uses [RestObjectFetch middleware](https://github.com/WRonX/Lumen-RestObjectFetch-middleware) in controller and routes (see middleware page to learn more) 
 * `-m|--create-model` for now it calls `make:model` command from [Lumen Generator](https://packagist.org/packages/flipbox/lumen-generator), hopefully it will be changed later 
 * `-g|--create-migration` for now it calls `make:migration` command, hopefully it will be changed later
 * `-t|--create-tests` creates CRUD tests code (needs some editing inside the file!)
 
 
## Contributing

If you want to contribute, **please wait**. Until stable version arrives I want to shape this package in my specific way. Later on, pull requests will be welcome.
